According to [research](https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-time-spent-with-media-2021-update), 90% of smartphone users spend their time on apps as opposed to 13% on the web. The mobile app market is set for a 385% growth rate in the future. Having a mobile app for your business could provide you with an extra edge when compared to your competitors.

However, with so many technologies available, choosing one would be a daunting task, especially if you’re starting out.

## The Million-Dollar Question. Is a Cross-platform App better than a Native App for your MVP?

If you ask us, the answer will most probably be cross-platform applications.

## What is an MVP?

![Which is better between a cross platform app and a native app](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/11062b_2b74c96468d4482a9697638a0dcc24b7~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_5000,h_2319,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/11062b_2b74c96468d4482a9697638a0dcc24b7~mv2.jpg)

An MVP or a minimum viable product is a basic version of the software that illustrates the core features of the product. It is built to test the idea and see how early adaptors respond to it. It is useful to gain feedback using a proof of concept before investing in the final product.

## What is Cross-Platform App Development?

Cross-platform app development is the building of apps that can work on multiple platforms. It provides the flexibility of coding with a universal language and reusing the code for different operating systems.

## Why choose a Cross-Platform App over a Native App?

![A cross-platform app is more cost effective than a native app](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_90071fcb0f0b4387a96d08640aa8a7b8~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_5000,h_3333,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/nsplsh_90071fcb0f0b4387a96d08640aa8a7b8~mv2.jpg)

## A Cross Platform App is cost-effective

If budget is a constraint, a cross-platform application is better than a native app. A cross-platform application takes less time to develop and thus costs at least 50% less than other expensive options like Native App Development.

## A Cross-Platform App Has a Faster Time to Market

Did you know that around [26,000 apps](https://42matters.com/ios-apple-app-store-statistics-and-trends) are released per month on the Apple Store and [81,000 apps](https://42matters.com/google-play-statistics-and-trends) are released per month on Google Play Store? For a business owner, time to develop an application is of great significance. With a cross-platform application, you can reduce the time to market as it uses a single code base. It will help you build an MVP as soon as possible and start testing.

## A Cross-Platform App is Perfect to Validate Ideas

It is always safe to first validate the idea for your app with a simple low-cost prototype. If validating the core features of an app is the goal, a cross-platform application is better than a native app since it is an economical and secure way to do so.

## A Cross-Platform App helps to Reach a Broader Audience

With a cross-platform application, you can reach more customers easily. Android and iOS make up around 99.24% of the smartphone operating systems market, with Android at 70.97% and iOS at 28.27%. If your goal is to reach both these audiences and more, cross-platform app development is the way to go.

![A cross-platform app is easy to maintain](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_f8c8862d7df14903a3483d751f39d30a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_5000,h_3333,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/nsplsh_f8c8862d7df14903a3483d751f39d30a~mv2.jpg)

## Reusable Code makes a Cross Platform App easier to implement

A cross-platform app shares a unified code. This single code base has high reusability. Developers do not need to write code every time. This is also why cost-platform apps are easier to implement.

## A Cross Platform App is Easier to Maintain

Since a cross-platform app uses a single code base, they are easier to maintain. It uses a unified code base which makes it easier to install upgrades or fix bugs. This ensures a higher quality experience.

In conclusion, if reaching a broader audience, as fast as possible with low development costs is your goal, we believe a cross-platform app is better than a native app for an MVP. It will provide a quality experience and with the “write once, run anywhere” approach performance issues can be fixed easily during the testing phase.
