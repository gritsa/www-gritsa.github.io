Welcome to the Gritsa Technologies blog! We're excited to launch this platform where we'll share insights, case studies, and technical deep-dives about the work we do transforming how software gets built.

## What to Expect

Our blog will cover three main areas that align with our core services:

### Full-Stack Development & Vibe Coding

We'll explore the realities of building production systems in the age of Gen AI coding tools. You'll find posts about:

- Solving the "vibe coding fatigue" problem when prototypes need to scale
- Our research on catastrophic forgetting in AI-assisted development
- Real-world case studies of DaaS (Development-as-a-Service) projects
- Architecture patterns for cross-platform applications

### Autonomous AI Agents

Beyond chatbots, we're building agents that do real work. Expect content about:

- The Jiva open-source framework and how it differs from proprietary platforms
- Use cases: supply chain automation, customer success workflows, data engineering
- Decision boundaries, error recovery, and production monitoring
- Integration patterns with CRMs, ERPs, and legacy systems

### Gen AI Data Pipelines

Data engineering is broken when pipelines fail silently. We'll share:

- How self-healing pipelines detect and fix problems autonomously
- Automated supplier communication workflows
- The write-audit-publish pattern for data quality
- Achieving 99.8% data availability vs typical 85-90%

## Our Perspective

Everything we write comes from building production systems for 15+ years, including Healthcare Insights (acquired by Premier Inc. for $65M in 2015). We're not consultants theorizing about best practices—we're engineers who've shipped systems that scale.

## From Research to Practice

Our work is informed by published research. Check out our [TechRxiv paper on catastrophic forgetting](https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.175571941.16848640) to understand how we think about the transition from Gen AI prototypes to production systems.

## Stay Connected

We'll be publishing regularly on topics that matter to founders, CTOs, and engineering teams trying to navigate the rapidly changing landscape of AI-assisted development.
